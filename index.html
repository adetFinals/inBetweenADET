The objective varies depending on the game variant, but typically involves either collecting certain combinations of cards, achieving the highest score, or being the last player remaining. Players take turns drawing and discarding cards, strategically managing their hand to achieve their objective while disrupting opponents' strategies. Luck and skill intersect as players make tactical decisions based on the cards they hold and the actions of their opponents. With a blend of strategy, probability, and social interaction, our card game promises hours of entertainment for players of all ages."</h1>
